# How is this different from the previous stan-playground?

The [previous version of stan-playground](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/old-introducing-stan-playground-a-web-based-platform-for-stan-programming-and-collaboration/31653) also provided a mechanism for running Stan models through the browser. However, that project relied on server-side processing for sampling. In contrast, this iteration of stan-playground (despite sharing the same name) performs all sampling directly within the browser, enhancing user control and privacy.
