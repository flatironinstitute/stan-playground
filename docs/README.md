# Stan Playground Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for [Stan Playground](https://stan-playground.flatironinstitute.org/)

## Feature overview

To get familiar with the layout of the Stan Playground interface and
the features it offers, see [SP: Feature Overview](./feature_overview.md)


## Preparing links to existing models or projects

Stan Playground offers a built-in sharing feature which integrates with
[Github Gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists).
This feature provides an easy way to share your work with collaborators, students,
forum users, and many other audiences.

Additionally, you can also prepare links which will pre-populate each portion of
Stan Playground when clicked.
For more information, see [SP: URL Parameters](./url_parameters.md).

## Embedding Stan Playground in your own site

Stan Playground provides a separate route and script for placing a compact
version of the SP interface in your own website, blog, or online tutorial.

Check out the how-to and examples at [SP: Embedded](./stan_playground_embedded.md).

## Custom compilation server setup

While the Stan models execute in the browser (on your local machine), the compilation process requires a dedicated server.
Most users will prefer to use the public server for compilation.
However, if you want to set up your own compilation server, use the following instructions:
