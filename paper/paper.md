# Summary

[Stan Playground](https://stan-playground.flatironinstitute.org/) is an in-browser editor
and execution environment for Stan [@Carpenter2017; @Stan2025] statistical models.
Models and analyses run entirely locally with no installation required, utilizing a bespoke
compilation server which translates users' models into WebAssembly modules built with the
Emscripten [@emscripten2011] toolchain. Built-in sharing features and integration with
Pyodide [@pyodide2021] and webR [@Stagg2023] make Stan Playground a complete environment
for instruction, prototyping, and analysis.

# Statement of need

Stan is a language for statistical modeling commonly used for Bayesian data analysis in
many fields. Using Stan consists of two steps: model _compilation_, where the users' Stan code is
transpiled to C++ and compiled by a C++ toolchain, and _sampling_, where the resulting model is
executed to perform statistical inference.

Because the models are themselves user-provided, model compilation requires end users to have a
working C++17 development environment installed in order to use Stan.
This requirement can be difficult to satisfy for users from less technical backgrounds or with
IT-imposed constraints on their systems. Installation-related questions are
ubiquitous on the Stan forums. This can be a particular pain point in learning environments,
where instructors do not want to spend a substantial fraction of their teaching time just to ensure
students have a working environment and copy of the relevant data and models.

Thanks to its browser-based design requiring no installation, Stan Playground allows users
to immediately focus on the issues of modeling and analysis that matter to them.
A user simply navigates to [https://stan-playground.flatironinstitute.org/](https://stan-playground.flatironinstitute.org/)
to get a blank project, or a student clicks on a link provided by their instructor with
code and data already populated. They can then begin editing, compiling, and running Stan models
immediately, regardless of their local system configuration.

A similar level of convenience could be achieved by performing both compilation and sampling on
centrally provided server, but there are several issues with this approach.
Sampling involves executing user-written code that could perform potentially-unbounded amounts of
compute. Offering this as a public service would require authentication or rate-limiting.
Additionally, even in a restricted language like Stan, one would have to take serious precautions before
allowing untrusted user code to run unchecked.

By contrast, providing a public server that only performs compilation is secure and practical.
Compilation times are similar for most models and compilation results can be cached, meaning
e.g. students in a classroom setting would only end up compiling the provided example once collectively.
Furthermore, compilation never executes any user-controlled code, obviating most security concerns.

With Stan Playground, getting started with Stan can be reduced from a lengthy, sometimes quite
technical, process into loading a web page in any modern browser.

# Key features

Stan Playground provides many features to allow end-to-end analysis projects to be completed in
the browser.

1. **Data Preparation**. The input data for the Stan model can be provided manually as JSON or
   generated by Python or R scripts which can download existing datasets or dynamically generate fake data.

2. **Model Editing**. The Stan editor in Stan Playground features integration with the Stan compiler
   to provide on-the-fly diagnostics and formatting.

3. **Compilation**. A premier feature of Stan Playground is the ability to compile and run without
   needing additional tools installed. This is achieved through a server that handles this compilation
   and provides WebAssembly modules back to the client. While a public server is hosted by the Flatiron Institute,
   users can also run their own and connect to that instead in the settings UI.

4. **Sampling**. User can control the key parameters for the sampling algorithm (number of iterations, etc) and
   monitor progress in real time.

5. **Posterior Analysis**. Stan Playground provides many built-in diagnostics and visualizations for the
   posterior sample. Additionally, users can write Python or R scripts to leverage the existing ecosystem of
   tools such as ArviZ [@Kumar_ArviZ_a_unified] or `posterior` [@posterior2025].

6. **Sharing and Export**. Stan Playground by default saves your analysis in browser local storage.
   For longer-term storage, users can export their projects to zip files for local use, or upload
   to a Github Gist. Github Gist links facilitate easy sharing, as they can be used in URL parameters
   to load a specific project when a link is clicked. More customizable sharing options are also available
   through URL parameters.

# Examples

Stan Playground provides several example programs on the left
sidebar of the home page at various levels of complexity, spanning from a basic
linear regression on fake data to
[a reimplementation of the model and analysis](https://stan-playground.flatironinstitute.org/?project=https://gist.github.com/WardBrian/d8ab811b137085f154b6145d3c36cbc4)
from @Carpenter2018. The above link uses Stan Playground's sharing features to pre-populate the project on page load.

# Implementation details

Stan Playground consists of two components. The first is a server that can compile Stan
models to WebAssembly, implemented in Python and leveraging the existing Emscripten toolchain [@emscripten2011].
This server is also published as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image if users wish to run their own local copy.

The remainder of the project is the user-facing web application, which can be found at
[https://stan-playground.flatironinstitute.org/](https://stan-playground.flatironinstitute.org/).

This web application is built on the [React](https://react.dev/) framework and features various
panels to allow editing of Stan models, compilation, sampling, and downstream analysis of the
results. The use of WebAssembly and web workers allows these computations to complete quickly
and without freezing the user interface.
